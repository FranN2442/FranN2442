### ABOUT ME
```
My first experience "programming" was in a medium grade, with very basic concepts.
Today I am learning a lot from the great world of programming and the very interesting things to learn from.
I am a creative person who likes to contribute the maximum of himself, organized and with goals and dreams to fulfill.
